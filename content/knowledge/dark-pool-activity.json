  "content_md": "## What Are Dark Pools?\n\nDark pools are private, off-exchange trading venues operated by banks and brokers. Unlike public exchanges like NYSE or NASDAQ, orders in dark pools are not visible until after execution.\n\nThis opacity serves a purpose: large institutional investors — pension funds, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds — need to buy or sell millions of shares without moving the price against themselves. Public markets would detect and front-run their orders. Dark pools provide anonymity.\n\n## The Volume Signal\n\nWhile individual dark pool orders are anonymous, aggregate volume statistics are reported to FINRA and published daily. This creates a detectable signal:\n\nWhen dark pool volume in a specific stock spikes well above its historical baseline, it indicates that large, sophisticated players are quietly accumulating (or distributing) shares.\n\nStatistical research shows:\n- **Pre-announcement dark pool spikes** correctly predict directional moves 60%+ of the time\n- **Z-scores above 2.5** in dark pool volume are statistically anomalous and actionable\n- The signal is strongest for **mid-cap stocks** where institutional ownership is less complete\n\n## Dark Pool Indicator (DPI)\n\nThe Dark Pool Index (DPI) measures dark pool volume as a percentage of total volume. High DPI means institutions are choosing to trade anonymously — typically a sign of informed trading.\n\nDPI > 55% + volume spike > 2 standard deviations = high-conviction institutional signal\n\n## How Meridian Uses This Signal\n\nMeridian processes FINRA ATS data daily and computes:\n\n- **Z-Score**: How many standard deviations above the 30-day baseline is today's dark pool volume?\n- **DPI**: What fraction of total volume is dark pool?\n- **Direction inference**: Using options flow and short interest to estimate whether dark accumulation is bullish or bearish\n- **Persistence**: Is the anomalous volume repeating over multiple sessions?\n\nScores are highest for stocks showing: Z-Score > 2.5, DPI > 55%, and 3+ consecutive days of elevated activity.\n\n## Limitations\n\n- Dark pool volume is available only with a 1-day lag (T+1 reporting)\n- Direction cannot be definitively determined from volume alone\n- Not all dark pool activity is informed — some is algorithmic matching of retail flow\n- Market-wide dark pool spikes (VIX events) reduce individual stock signal strength",
