  "content_md": "## The Fundamental Logic\n\nWho knows a company better than the people running it? Corporate insiders — CEOs, CFOs, board members — have access to forward revenue projections, pipeline status, R&D milestones, and competitive intelligence that the public never sees.\n\nWhen they put their own money in at market prices, that's a meaningful signal.\n\n## What the Research Shows\n\nDecades of academic research have confirmed insider buying outperforms:\n\n- **Lakonishok & Lee (2001)**: Insider purchases predict future returns; sells do not\n- **Cohen, Malloy & Pomorski (2012)**: \"Routine\" vs \"opportunistic\" insiders — opportunistic buyers outperform by **8–9% annually**\n- **Jeng, Metrick & Zeckhauser (2003)**: Insider purchases generate **11.2% annual abnormal returns**\n\n## Buys vs. Sells: A Crucial Asymmetry\n\nInsider buying and selling carry very different information content:\n\n**Buys are informative** because:\n- Insiders only buy when they believe the stock is undervalued\n- They have unlimited alternatives for where to invest their money\n- Buying concentrates personal wealth in a single stock — a risk they'd only take with conviction\n\n**Sells are noisy** because:\n- Executives sell for many reasons: diversification, taxes, estate planning, home purchases\n- Sell signals are diluted by these non-informational motivations\n\n## Cluster Buying: The High-Conviction Pattern\n\nThe strongest insider signal isn't one executive buying — it's multiple executives buying simultaneously, known as **cluster buying**.\n\nWhen a CEO, CFO, and two board members all buy in the same 2-week window, that represents coordinated confidence from people with different vantage points inside the company.\n\nResearch shows cluster buys (3+ insiders) generate **2–3x** the excess return of individual purchases.\n\n## How Meridian Uses This Signal\n\nMeridian processes SEC Form 4 filings in real-time. Our insider signal scores weight:\n\n- **Transaction value** — larger purchases signal higher conviction\n- **Clustering** — multiple insiders = exponential score boost\n- **Role seniority** — CEO/CFO buys weighted higher than Director buys\n- **Timing recency** — fresher filings score higher\n- **Price context** — buys after drawdowns (>15% off highs) score highest\n\n## When Insider Signals Fail\n\nInsider buying doesn't work in every context:\n\n- **Mandatory purchase programs** reduce informativeness of scheduled buys\n- **Options exercise** often accompanies sells, creating mixed signals\n- **Micro-cap liquidity issues** can make large insider positions impractical to exit\n- **Regulatory investigation periods** (quiet periods) limit trading and timing\n\nMeridian filters out routine, scheduled, and option-related transactions to isolate the highest-conviction discretionary purchases.",
