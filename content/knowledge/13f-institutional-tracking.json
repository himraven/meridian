  "content_md": "## The Signal\n\nEvery quarter, thousands of the world's most sophisticated investors are legally required to show their cards. SEC Form 13F — filed by any institution managing more than $100 million in U.S. equities — creates one of the most valuable public datasets in finance. At any given time, over 10,000 institutional investors including hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds, endowments, and family offices must disclose their long equity positions within 45 days of each quarter-end.\n\nThis transparency creates an extraordinary opportunity for retail and systematic investors: the chance to peer inside the portfolios of managers who spend millions of dollars annually on research, have direct access to company management teams, and have track records measured in decades. While the disclosure lag means you are never seeing real-time positions, the data still contains a remarkable amount of actionable information — particularly when you know where to look.\n\nThe key insight, validated by decades of academic research, is that 13F data is not equally informative across all positions. The signal quality varies dramatically depending on which stocks you focus on and which managers you follow. The art of institutional tracking is learning to filter noise from signal — to find the handful of positions that truly represent a manager's deepest conviction, rather than the hundreds of positions that simply reflect passive exposure or window dressing.\n\n## Why It Predicts Returns\n\nThe academic foundation for 13F-based investing rests on a counterintuitive finding. For decades, the conventional wisdom held that active fund managers, on average, fail to beat the market. This is largely true. Yet buried within these underperforming portfolios is a subset of positions where managers are genuinely skilled.\n\nCohen, Polk, and Silli's landmark 2010 paper \"Best Ideas\" is the cornerstone of this field. Analyzing thousands of fund managers over multiple decades, they found that a fund's single best idea — typically its largest position by weight relative to the benchmark — outperformed the benchmark by **1.6 to 2.1% per quarter**, or roughly 6-8% annually. This is a staggering amount of alpha. The same paper found that a manager's second and third best ideas also generated meaningful excess returns, but the effect diluted rapidly as you moved further down the position list. The bottom half of a typical fund's portfolio showed essentially no skill whatsoever.\n\nThe explanation is elegant: fund managers face career and business pressures that force over-diversification. A manager who genuinely believes in only 10 stocks is forced to hold 50 or 100 to satisfy institutional mandates, track error constraints, and risk management requirements. The \"real\" portfolio — the one reflecting genuine conviction — is hidden inside the larger one. 13F data lets you extract it.\n\nVerbeek and Wang extended this research with their paper \"Better than the Original?\" They found that systematic clone portfolios constructed from 13F data actually **outperformed the original funds after fees** — a remarkable result given that cloners pay no management fees, no performance fees, and face no liquidity constraints. They also documented that the signal strength increased dramatically after the SEC mandated quarterly rather than semi-annual disclosure in 2004, consistent with the idea that more frequent data improves signal quality.\n\nSchroeder's research pushed the finding further, showing that clone portfolios constructed from top-quartile managers — those with consistent long-term outperformance records — generated **+24.3% annualized risk-adjusted excess returns** compared to the S&P 500. Even applying deep skepticism about data mining, the evidence across multiple independent studies points to a robust and persistent signal in institutional positioning data.\n\nMore recent work using machine learning further validates the approach. Fleiss et al. applied deep reinforcement learning to 13F data and generated backtested returns of 21% annually with a Sharpe ratio of 1.8 — substantially outperforming the benchmark on both raw return and risk-adjusted metrics.\n\n## The Evidence in Numbers\n\n- **+1.6–2.1% per quarter** excess return from fund managers' single Best Ideas (Cohen, Polk & Silli, 2010)\n- **Clone portfolios outperform** the original funds after fees (Verbeek & Wang)\n- **+24.3% annualized** risk-adjusted excess from top-quartile clone portfolios (Schroeder)\n- **21% annual returns, Sharpe 1.8** using RL models on 13F data (Fleiss et al.)\n- **10,000+ institutions** file 13F quarterly, creating vast searchable dataset\n- **45-day maximum lag** from quarter-end to public disclosure\n- **Signal strengthens** when 3+ top managers hold the same position simultaneously\n- Quarterly 13F data outperforms semi-annual data — more data, better signal (Verbeek & Wang)\n- **Best Ideas effect** is strongest for managers with concentrated portfolios (top 10 positions > 50% of AUM)\n- Conviction cluster signals (5+ managers in same name) show **2x the alpha** of single-manager signals\n\n## How Meridian Uses This Signal\n\nMeridian's institutional tracking engine monitors approximately 300 high-conviction fund managers selected for consistent long-term outperformance, concentrated portfolios, and low turnover. For each manager, we identify their \"Best Ideas\" — positions where their conviction significantly exceeds their benchmark weight — and aggregate these into a conviction-weighted score. When multiple top managers hold the same position, the score compounds: three independent research teams reaching the same conclusion carries far more information than one.\n\nThe signal feeds into Meridian's composite Smart Money Score, which combines institutional positioning with insider buying, congressional trading, and dark pool activity. A stock scoring highly across all four dimensions has had its investment case validated by multiple independent categories of sophisticated capital. Importantly, Meridian applies a conviction filter rather than simply tracking all 13F holdings: we specifically weight against mega-cap positions (where nearly every fund holds Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia for index-tracking reasons) and instead focus on mid-cap positions where active judgment genuinely dominates passive flows. The 45-day lag is a genuine limitation, which is why we weight 13F signals most heavily for low-turnover value and quality managers, whose positions tend to be stable across multiple quarters.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- 13F filings cover 10,000+ institutions managing $100M+ in U.S. equities, filed quarterly\n- Fund managers' single Best Ideas outperform the benchmark by 1.6–2.1% per quarter — even after disclosure lag\n- Clone portfolios from top-quartile managers beat the market by 24%+ on a risk-adjusted basis annually\n- Signal is strongest when filtered for high conviction (largest positions by relative weight) and manager quality\n- Multi-manager overlap dramatically increases signal reliability — consensus among independent research teams is powerful\n- The 45-day lag is manageable for low-turnover strategies; combine with other real-time signals for higher-turnover bets\n- Free to access via SEC EDGAR; platforms like WhaleWisdom and Dataroma aggregate and rank institutional positions\n\n## Expert Perspectives\n\n> \"You don't need to do your own research. You need to identify who is doing first-rate research — and then follow their highest-conviction judgments.\" — Inspired by the Buffett approach to capital allocation, as articulated in the 13F cloning literature\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is one of the most closely watched 13F filers in the world, with every quarterly disclosure triggering extensive media coverage. Buffett has long argued that concentrated, high-conviction investing is the path to superior long-term returns.

When tracking institutional 13F data, understanding the investment thesis behind a position matters as much as knowing the position exists. [profile →](/knowledge/masters/ray-dalio)\n\n> \"If you avoid the losers, the winners take care of themselves.\" — Howard Marks\n\nHoward Marks' second-level thinking applies directly to 13F analysis: the question isn't just what top managers are buying, but whether the information is already priced into the market by the time you act on it. The 45-day lag is real — which is why filtering for low-turnover, high-conviction managers is essential.

Dataroma.com is the simplest starting point: it aggregates the reported holdings of approximately 70 of the most widely followed superinvestors and hedge funds, updated after each quarterly filing deadline. You can see at a glance which stocks are most widely held, which positions were added or increased most recently, and which managers share overlapping views on a given company.\n\nWhaleWisdom offers a more quantitative approach, providing historical 13F data with backtesting capabilities that allow you to validate how specific clone strategies would have performed over prior years. Their \"Whalescore\" metric ranks funds by historical stock-picking performance, giving you a pre-filtered list of the managers whose disclosures are most worth tracking. For the technically inclined, the SEC's own EDGAR database provides raw 13F XML files accessible via API, making it possible to build custom aggregation and scoring tools in Python with relatively modest effort.\n\nQuiver Quantitative has emerged as one of the most useful platforms for institutional data in a structured, API-accessible format — particularly valuable for quantitative investors who want to incorporate 13F signals into systematic models. The key lesson from practitioners who have used these tools extensively: the quality of your filter matters far more than the breadth of coverage. Tracking 20 high-conviction managers with documented long-term outperformance is more valuable than aggregating signals from all 10,000+ 13F filers, most of whom add no incremental information beyond what passive indices already reflect.",
