  "content_md": "## Why Congressional Trades Have Predictive Power\n\nWhen a U.S. Senator buys stock in a defense contractor the week before a new Pentagon budget is announced, is that coincidence? Academic research suggests it usually isn't.\n\nCongressional trading has been one of the most consistently documented information edges in the market. Members of Congress have legal access to non-public information through committee hearings, regulatory briefings, and advance knowledge of legislation — and their portfolios reflect it.\n\n## The Research Evidence\n\nA landmark 2004 study by Ziobrowski et al. found that U.S. Senators beat the market by an average of **12% annually**. A follow-up 2011 study on House members showed similar outperformance of **6% per year**.\n\nMore recent work (2025, International Review of Economics & Finance) focusing on short-term windows found:\n\n- **+6% excess return** in the 30 days following a disclosure\n- Trading volume increases **~50%** during active congressional sessions\n- The edge is strongest in **committee-relevant sectors** (defense, healthcare, energy)\n\n## The STOCK Act and the Disclosure Window\n\nThe STOCK Act (Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act) was passed in 2012 requiring members to disclose trades within **45 days**. This created an actionable signal window: by the time trades are disclosed, there's still time to react.\n\nKey dynamics:\n\n1. **Disclosure lag** — 45-day window creates systematic delay between trade and public knowledge\n2. **Cluster signals** — when multiple members trade the same stock, the signal strengthens significantly\n3. **Committee correlation** — trades in sectors overlapping with a member's committee assignments carry higher predictive weight\n\n## How Meridian Uses This Signal\n\nMeridian monitors congressional disclosures in real-time through EDGAR and Quiver Quantitative feeds. Our scoring model weights each trade by:\n\n- **Transaction size** relative to the member's typical activity\n- **Recency** — fresher disclosures score higher\n- **Multi-member clustering** — when 3+ members trade the same ticker, conviction multiplies\n- **Committee alignment** — does this member sit on a relevant committee?\n\nThe result is a congressional signal score (0–100) for each ticker, updated daily.\n\n## Important Caveats\n\nCongress trades are a **leading indicator**, not a guarantee. Consider:\n\n- Some trades are made by spouses or financial advisors with no congressional knowledge\n- The 45-day lag means you're often acting on news that's already partially priced in\n- Not all outperformance is from inside information — members may simply be better connected to economic trends\n\nUse congressional signals as **one input** in a multi-signal framework, not a standalone trading trigger.",
