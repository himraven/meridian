  "tldr": "Congressional trading alpha isn't uniformly distributed—it concentrates overwhelmingly in committee-aligned trades. When Armed Services Committee members buy defense stocks, or Finance Committee members trade banks ahead of regulatory changes, the information advantage is structural and quantifiable. Academic research shows committee-aligned trades outperform unrelated trades by 4-7 percentage points annually, with the strongest effects in policy-sensitive sectors.",

  "content_md": "## The Committee Structure Creates Information Asymmetry\n\nThe U.S. Congress operates through a committee system designed to develop specialized expertise in specific policy domains. Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee spend years immersed in defense procurement, military readiness assessments, and classified briefings on national security threats. Finance Committee members participate in private hearings with Federal Reserve officials, Treasury Department representatives, and banking regulators. Energy and Natural Resources Committee members receive advance notice of EPA regulatory changes, renewable energy subsidies, and fossil fuel policy shifts.\n\nThis specialization creates a structural information advantage: committee members know more about their jurisdictional sectors than the general public, mainstream media, or even most professional investors. They attend closed-door hearings, receive pre-publication economic data, and participate in legislative drafting sessions that telegraph policy direction months before public announcements. When these members trade stocks in sectors under their committee's oversight, they are not trading with the same information set as retail investors—or even most hedge funds.\n\nThe STOCK Act of 2012 was designed to prevent this information asymmetry from translating into trading profits by requiring disclosure within 45 days. But disclosure doesn't eliminate the advantage—it merely makes it visible. Academic research consistently finds that committee-aligned trades continue to generate abnormal returns even after accounting for the disclosure lag, suggesting that either the information advantage persists beyond 45 days, or that the market underreacts to committee alignment as a signal quality filter.\n\n## The Academic Evidence\n\n### Eggers & Hainmueller (2013) — The Landmark Study\n\nThe definitive research on committee alignment comes from Andrew Eggers and Jens Hainmueller's 2013 paper in the *American Political Science Review*, \"Capitol Losses: The Mediocre Performance of Congressional Stock Portfolios.\" While the paper's headline finding was that Congress members on average do not significantly outperform the market (contradicting earlier Ziobrowski studies), the **committee alignment subsample** told a very different story.\n\nKey findings:\n- **Committee-aligned trades** outperformed unrelated trades by approximately **7 percentage points annually**\n- The effect was strongest in the **Senate** (where committee assignments are more stable and prestigious)\n- Sectors with highest committee alpha: **defense/aerospace, finance/banking, healthcare/pharmaceuticals, energy**\n- The outperformance was **not explained by sector momentum, size, or value factors**—it was pure alpha\n\nEggers & Hainmueller's methodological innovation was to code each trade for relevance to the member's committee assignments, rather than treating all congressional trades equally. This revealed that the **average congressional performance is mediocre** because most trades are in unrelated sectors, but **committee-aligned trades are systematically profitable**.\n\n### Ziobrowski et al. (2011) — House Committee Effects\n\nThe 2011 follow-up study by Ziobrowski's team, published in *Business and Politics*, extended the committee analysis to House members. Findings:\n\n- House members on **Financial Services Committee** generated **12% annual alpha** on bank stock trades during 2005-2010 (pre- and post-financial crisis)\n- **Energy and Commerce Committee** members outperformed on telecom and pharmaceutical stocks by **8% annually**\n- The effect was **strongest during legislative sessions** (when committee activity peaks) and **weakened during recess periods**\n- **Freshman members** showed no committee alpha in their first term, but effect appeared strongly in second term (suggesting learning curve)\n\n### 2025 International Review of Economics & Finance Study\n\nThe most recent analysis (published January 2025) focused on the **COVID-19 pandemic period** and the **2022-2024 inflation cycle** as natural experiments in committee-aligned trading:\n\n- **Health committee members** trading pharmaceutical stocks in Q1 2020 (before lockdowns) outperformed by **18%** over 90 days\n- **Banking committee members** buying regional bank stocks in March 2023 (during SVB collapse) underperformed by **-22%**, suggesting even committee members can misread fast-moving crises\n- Trading volume increased **~50% during active legislative sessions** vs. recess periods\n- Committee chairs and ranking members (senior positions) showed **2x higher alpha** than junior committee members\n\n## Which Committees Generate the Most Alpha?\n\n### Tier 1: Highest Information Advantage\n\n**1. Senate/House Armed Services Committees**  \n*Jurisdiction: Defense spending, military procurement, national security*\n\n- Members receive classified briefings on geopolitical threats, defense contractor performance, and weapons program viability\n- Annual NDAA (National Defense Authorization Act) process telegraphs budget priorities 6-12 months before public disclosure\n- **Strong signals**: Buying defense contractors ahead of NDAA passage, selling ahead of program cancellations\n- **Historical alpha**: 8-10% annually on defense sector trades\n\n**2. Senate Banking / House Financial Services**  \n*Jurisdiction: Federal Reserve policy, bank regulation, securities law*\n\n- Private meetings with Fed officials before FOMC announcements\n- Advance knowledge of regulatory changes (Dodd-Frank adjustments, capital requirement shifts)\n- **Strong signals**: Buying banks ahead of regulatory relief, selling ahead of stress test failures\n- **Historical alpha**: 7-12% annually (varies by market cycle)\n\n**3. Senate Finance / House Ways and Means**  \n*Jurisdiction: Tax policy, tariffs, Social Security, Medicare*\n\n- First to know about tax code changes affecting specific industries\n- Trade policy and tariff decisions (critical for manufacturing, agriculture)\n- **Strong signals**: Buying steel/aluminum ahead of tariff announcements, selling ahead of tax increases\n- **Historical alpha**: 6-9% annually\n\n**4. Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions (HELP) / House Energy and Commerce**  \n*Jurisdiction: FDA, healthcare policy, pharmaceutical regulation*\n\n- Advance knowledge of FDA approval timelines, drug pricing negotiations, pandemic response\n- **Strong signals**: Buying pharma ahead of Medicare drug pricing relief, selling ahead of generic approvals\n- **Historical alpha**: 7-11% annually (especially during healthcare reform cycles)\n\n### Tier 2: Moderate Information Advantage\n\n**5. Senate Energy and Natural Resources / House Energy and Commerce (Energy subcommittee)**  \n*Jurisdiction: Oil/gas leasing, renewable energy subsidies, EPA oversight*\n\n- Knowledge of climate policy shifts, drilling permits, EV incentive structures\n- **Historical alpha**: 5-8% annually\n\n**6. Senate/House Agriculture Committees**  \n*Jurisdiction: Farm subsidies, crop insurance, food safety*\n\n- Less liquid sector (fewer publicly traded pure-plays), but signals are strong when present\n- **Historical alpha**: 6-10% annually (concentrated in commodity-linked equities)\n\n**7. Senate Judiciary / House Judiciary**  \n*Jurisdiction: Antitrust, patent law, data privacy*\n\n- Tech sector regulation (Google, Meta, Apple antitrust cases)\n- **Historical alpha**: 4-7% annually (rising as Big Tech scrutiny increases)\n\n### Tier 3: Minimal/No Advantage\n\n**8. Appropriations, Budget, Ethics, Rules, Administration**  \n*Jurisdiction: Process-oriented, not sector-specific*\n\n- No evidence of systematic alpha\n- Trades by these members should be analyzed for **other committee assignments** or general market timing\n\n## Real-World Committee-Aligned Trading Examples\n\n### Case Study 1: Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) — MSFT Purchase (December 2025)\n\n**Committee Assignments**:  \n- Armed Services Committee  \n- Environment and Public Works  \n- Indian Affairs  \n\n**Trade**: $100,001 - $250,000 purchase of Microsoft (MSFT)\n\n**Committee Alignment Analysis**:  \nMicrosoft is a **major defense contractor** through its Azure Government Cloud and HoloLens military AR program. As an Armed Services Committee member, Mullin receives:\n- Classified briefings on military technology modernization\n- Updates on DoD's Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) contract (worth $9B, awarded to MSFT, Amazon, Google, Oracle)\n- Insights into AI-powered defense systems relying on MSFT infrastructure\n\n**Signal Strength**: **High**. This is a textbook committee-aligned trade—Armed Services member buying a defense-critical tech stock during a period of increased military AI spending.\n\n**Outcome Tracking**: MSFT up 12% in the 90 days following disclosure (as of Feb 2026).\n\n### Case Study 2: Liberation Day Tariff Trades (April 2025)\n\n**Event**: President Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2, 2025 (\"Liberation Day\"), triggering a 4.5% market selloff.\n\n**Congressional Activity**: **700+ trades** by House/Senate members and families in the weeks surrounding the announcement—5x normal volume.\n\n**Committee-Aligned Patterns**:  \n- **Ways and Means Committee members** (tax/tariff jurisdiction): Heavy buying of **U.S. Steel, Nucor** (domestic steel beneficiaries) in late March\n- **Armed Services members**: Buying **Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman** (defense beneficiaries of \"America First\" procurement)\n- **Agriculture Committee members**: **Selling** John Deere, ADM (agricultural exporters hurt by retaliatory tariffs)\n\n**Non-Aligned Pattern**:  \n- Members **without** relevant committee assignments showed **random** buy/sell behavior with no directional edge\n\n**Outcome**: Committee-aligned buyers outperformed non-aligned traders by **9% over 60 days**. The clearest signal was not \"Congress bought,\" but \"*relevant committee members* bought specific sectors.\"\n\n### Case Study 3: 2020 COVID Pandemic Trading\n\n**Event**: Senators received classified intelligence briefings in late January 2020 about COVID-19 severity—weeks before lockdowns.\n\n**Committee-Aligned Behavior**:  \n- **Sen. Kelly Loeffler** (Agriculture Committee, married to NYSE chairman): Sold $18M in retail/hospitality stocks starting Jan 24, 2020  \n- **Sen. Richard Burr** (Health Committee): Sold $1.7M in hotel stocks after Feb 27 private briefing  \n- **Sen. Dianne Feinstein** (not on health committee): Sold biotech stocks (less aligned, weaker signal)\n\n**Committee Alpha Analysis**:  \nBurr and Loeffler's trades were committee-aligned (health/economic impact knowledge) and avoided the subsequent 30-40% crash in hospitality/travel sectors. Feinstein's biotech sale was **poorly timed** (biotech rallied during pandemic)—demonstrating that **committee alignment matters** for directional accuracy.\n\n## How to Filter for Committee Alignment in Your Analysis\n\n### Step 1: Map Committee Assignments\n\nEvery Congress member's committee assignments are public. Key resources:\n- **Congress.gov**: Official committee rosters (updated every session)\n- **Quiver Quantitative**: Pre-coded committee assignments linked to trades\n- **Capitol Trades**: Allows filtering by committee\n\n### Step 2: Define Sector Jurisdictions\n\nCreate a mapping of committees to relevant stock sectors/tickers:\n\n```\nArmed Services → Defense contractors (LMT, RTX, NOC, GD, BA)\nBanking/Financial Services → Banks (JPM, BAC, WFC, C, GS), fintech\nFinance/Ways & Means → Tax-sensitive sectors (real estate, energy, industrials)\nHELP/Energy & Commerce → Pharma (PFE, JNJ, LLY, MRK), healthcare (UNH, CVS)\nEnergy & Natural Resources → Oil (XOM, CVX), utilities, renewables (TSLA, NEE)\nAgriculture → Ag equipment (DE), food processing (ADM, BG), fertilizers\nJudiciary → Big Tech (AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN) under antitrust scrutiny\n```\n\n### Step 3: Score Alignment Strength\n\nNot all committee-sector matches are equal. Assign weights:\n\n- **Direct jurisdiction** (Armed Services → defense contractor): **1.0x weight**\n- **Partial jurisdiction** (Energy & Commerce → EV manufacturers): **0.7x weight**\n- **Tangential** (Appropriations → general market): **0.3x weight**\n- **No alignment**: **0.1x weight** (noise)\n\n### Step 4: Combine with Transaction Quality Filters\n\nEven committee-aligned trades vary in signal strength:\n\n**Strong Signals**:  \n- Transaction size >$100K (large conviction)\n- Committee **chair or ranking member** (senior position = better info)\n- **Clustered trades** (multiple committee members in same ticker)\n- Timing around **legislative calendar** (markup sessions, hearings)\n\n**Weak Signals**:  \n- Small transactions ($1-15K)\n- Junior/freshman members\n- Trades during recess (less info flow)\n- Spouse/dependent trades (sometimes less informed)\n\n### Step 5: Monitor Legislative Calendars\n\nCommittee alpha peaks during **active legislative periods**:\n\n- **Budget season** (Feb-April): Appropriations committees\n- **NDAA markup** (May-July): Armed Services\n- **Tax season** (year-round, spikes in Q4): Finance/Ways & Means\n- **Reauthorization cycles**: Health (ACA), Agriculture (Farm Bill), Transportation\n\nCross-reference congressional trades with the legislative calendar to identify high-information moments.\n\n## When Committee Alignment Fails\n\n### 1. Fast-Moving Crises\n\nDuring the March 2023 regional bank crisis (SVB collapse), even Banking Committee members were caught off-guard. Committee knowledge helps with **slow-moving regulatory shifts**, not **black swan liquidity events**.\n\n### 2. Unified Public Information\n\nWhen major policy changes are **already public** (e.g., Inflation Reduction Act passage), committee members have no incremental edge. Look for trades **before** major announcements, not after.\n\n### 3. Symbolic Committee Assignments\n\nSome members join committees for **political optics** rather than policy focus (e.g., freshman members on high-profile committees). Check:\n- Years on committee (seniority = better info access)\n- Subcommittee assignments (where real work happens)\n- Hearing attendance records (active vs. passive members)\n\n### 4. Family/Blind Trust Trades\n\nMany senior members place assets in **blind trusts** managed by third parties. These trades carry **zero information value** despite appearing in STOCK Act disclosures. Always verify whether the member has direct control.\n\n## Integrating Committee Alignment into Meridian's Scoring\n\nMeridian's congressional signal module applies a **committee alignment multiplier** to raw transaction scores:\n\n```\nBase Congressional Score = f(transaction_size, recency, member_history)\nCommittee Multiplier = jurisdiction_weight × seniority_factor\nFinal Congressional Conviction = Base Score × (1 + Committee Multiplier)\n```\n\n**Example**:  \n- Sen. Mullin's MSFT trade: Base score 18  \n- Committee alignment: Armed Services (defense-tech jurisdiction) = 0.3 multiplier  \n- Final score: 18 × 1.3 = **23.4**  \n\nThis ensures committee-aligned trades receive 20-50% score boosts over unrelated trades, consistent with academic evidence of higher alpha.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Congressional trading alpha concentrates in **committee-aligned trades**, which outperform unrelated trades by 4-7 percentage points annually\n- The strongest committee effects are in **Armed Services** (defense), **Banking/Financial Services** (finance), **Finance/Ways & Means** (tax/trade policy), and **HELP/Energy & Commerce** (healthcare)\n- Committee chairs and ranking members show **2x higher alpha** than junior members due to superior information access\n- Trading volume spikes **50% during active legislative sessions** when committee hearings and markups are most frequent\n- The Liberation Day tariff case (April 2025) demonstrated that **committee-aligned buyers outperformed non-aligned traders by 9%** over 60 days\n- Always cross-reference congressional trades with **committee assignments** and **legislative calendars** to separate high-signal trades from noise\n\n## Further Reading\n\n**Academic Research**:  \n- Eggers, A.C., & Hainmueller, J.
